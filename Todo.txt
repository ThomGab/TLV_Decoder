ToDo


1) Restructure the switch cases, so they are not reliant upon int's and instead are named #DEFINE variables

2) Create a TLV_Block structure, with child and parent flags. <- Done

3) Use the TLV_Block structure mentioned above to implemented constructed data objects.
 <Done
 
 4) Add error handling for bad/messed up data.
 
 5) Refactor code so it's legible by another human being.
